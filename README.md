# Diablo-II-RuneKeeper

Python App using D2Lib (https://github.com/artcom-net/d2lib) to read Diablo II character files and show what runewords can be created from the runes available on the character. 
Can also read stash and Plugy shared stash files as well. 

At the moment it only works on Linux and needs Tkinter, D2Lib.
